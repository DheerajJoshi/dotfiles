Dotfiles are set of default hidden files for configuration purpouses,
if you want to install this you will need rake installed,
just run `rake install` and pray to the octogods, this repository
is just intended to satisfy my needs, yours may be different, copy whatever you want or need,
and there is no guarantee that my setup will work on your computer.

Interesting plugins for rbenv:
### [rbenv-gem-rehash](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv-gem-rehash)
### [rbenv-default-gems](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv-default-gems)

If you're using Awesome WM, then you will need to download the themes here (or things will look weird):
